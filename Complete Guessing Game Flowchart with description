## Process Description

1. Start: The program begins.
2. Generate random number: The computer selects a random number within a specified range.
3. Get user guess: The program prompts the user to input their guess.
4. Is input valid?: The program checks if the user's input is a valid number within the game's range.
   - If not valid, display an error message and ask for another guess.
   - If valid, proceed to check if the guess is correct.
5. Is guess correct?: Compare the user's guess with the generated number.
   - If correct, display a win message.
   - If incorrect, check if the guess is too high or too low.
6. Display feedback: Tell the user if their guess was too high or too low.
7. Play again?: Ask the user if they want to play another round.
   - If yes, generate a new random number and start over.
   - If no, end the program.
8. End: The program terminates.
